        <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>

        <p>Welcome to BudgetSphere — an expense tracking application. Please read these Terms & Conditions ("Terms")
            carefully before using the application. By accessing or using BudgetSphere you agree to be bound by these
            Terms.</p>

        <h2>1. Use of the application</h2>
        <p>BudgetSphere is provided for personal and small-business expense tracking. You agree to use the app only for
            lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms.</p>

        <h2>2. Accounts and data</h2>
        <p>If the app requires an account, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your credentials.
            You own the content and financial data you enter into the application, but you grant BudgetSphere a license
            to store and process that data to provide the service.</p>

        <h2>3. Data privacy</h2>
        <p>Please review our Privacy Policy for details about how we collect, use, and protect your personal data. The
            Terms and Privacy Policy together govern your use of the service.</p>

        <h2>4. Third-party services</h2>
        <p>BudgetSphere may integrate with third-party services. Your use of those services is subject to the third
            parties' terms and privacy practices.</p>

        <h2>5. Limitation of liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, BudgetSphere and its affiliates are not liable for any indirect,
            incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of your use of the app. The total
            liability for claims related to the service shall not exceed the amounts you have paid to use the service
            (if any) in the 12 months prior to the claim, or a nominal amount if no payment was made.</p>

        <h2>6. Changes to these Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will revise the "last updated" date. Continued
            use after changes means you accept the new Terms.</p>

        <h2>7. Contact</h2>
        <p>If you have questions about these Terms, contact the support address provided in the app or README.</p>
